# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Neverland: Pirate Island

> ‚ÄúNow... bring me that horizon.‚Äù ‚Äî *Captain Jack Sparrow*

this is a 3D pirate island built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io). it is quite static in its functionality (except for the onclick animations on all the idle-y animated models) made as a fun website for exploration!
